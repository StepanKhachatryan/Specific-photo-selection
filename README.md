# Specific-photo-selection
Select and move/copy specific photos from folder based on names in a list (in text file)

I had a folder with more than one million images. I had a text file with the names of images (5000 images), which I need to move from folder.
To select images one by one is trrible, so that I wrote code in Python to do it automatically.
