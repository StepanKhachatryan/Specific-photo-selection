# Specific-photo-selection
Select and move/copy specific photos from folder based on names in a list (in text file)

I had a folder with more than one million images. I had a text file with the names of images (approximetly 5000 images), which I need to move from the folder.
To select images one by one was trrible, so that I wrote a code in Python to do it automatically
