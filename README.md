# Specific-photo-selection
Select and move/copy specific photos from folder based on names in a list (in text file)

I had a folder with more than one million images. Also, I had a text file with approximetly 5000 names of images in the folder. I had a task to find the images, which were in the list and move them from the folder. I wrote a small code in Python to select and move intereested images from the folder, as it was terrible job to do it one by one manually.
